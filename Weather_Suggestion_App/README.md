# Weather Suggestion App ‚Äì Python Beginner Project

This is a beginner-level interactive project created as part of the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/).

It demonstrates how Python can make decisions using conditional statements based on user input.

---

## Project Objective

Create a Python program that:
- Asks the user for the current weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
- Suggests an activity using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Also implements the same logic using a **ternary operator**

This project is designed to improve understanding of:
- Control flow in Python
- Truthy and falsy values
- User interaction with `input()`

## üí¨ Notes

This project is part of my ongoing journey to learn Python through practical, real-world scenarios. It uses both long-form conditional blocks and the ternary operator to showcase two ways to handle logic.
