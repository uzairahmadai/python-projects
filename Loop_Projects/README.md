# Loop Projects â€“ Python Beginner Series

This notebook includes **7 beginner-level Python projects** that explore how `for` loops, `while` loops, and loop control statements work in real-world examples.

These projects are part of my learning journey in the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/), focused on mastering Python fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## Project List

### Project 1: Squaring a List  
Use a `for` loop to calculate the square of numbers from 1 to 5 and store them in a list.

### Project 2: Squaring Even Numbers  
Loop from 1 to 10, check for even numbers, and save their squares.

### Project 3: Automated Invitation System  
Send personalized invitation messages to a list of friends using a `for` loop.

### Project 4: Password Checker  
Use a `while` loop to keep prompting the user until the correct password is entered.

### Project 5: Number Analysis  
Sum even numbers in a user-defined range while skipping numbers divisible by 5 using `continue`.

### Project 6: Countdown Timer  
Use a `while` loop to create a countdown from a user-defined number to 0.

### Project 7: Multiplication Table  
Use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table for a user-provided number.
