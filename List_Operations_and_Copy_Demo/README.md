# 🧮 List Operations and Copy Behavior – Python Beginner Projects

This notebook combines two beginner-level projects I completed as part of the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/). The focus is on understanding how lists work in Python and how shallow vs. deep copies behave.

---

## 📌 Project 2: List Operations Demo

This section demonstrates how to:
- Append a new item to a list using `append()`
- Insert an item at a specific position using `insert()`
- Remove the last item with `pop()`
- Remove a specific item by value using `remove()`
- Sort the list alphabetically with `sort()`
- Reverse the order of items using `reverse()`

## 📌 Project 3: Shallow vs. Deep Copy

This section explores how copying lists works in Python:
- What happens when two variables point to the same list (`=`)
- How to create a deep copy using `.copy()`
- How to use slicing `[:]` to make an independent list
- How changes to one list affect the other

## 💬 Notes

This notebook was created without using any functions, loops, or conditionals — making it fully beginner-friendly. The goal was to explore basic list behaviors and improve my hands-on understanding of Python collections.
