# Grading System – Python Beginner Project

This is a beginner-level logic project created as part of the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/).

It demonstrates how to use conditional statements to determine a student’s grade based on a numerical score.

---

## Project Objective

Build a Python program that:
- Accepts a numerical score (0 to 100) from the user
- Uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to determine the letter grade (A, B, C, F)
- Adds `+` or `−` to the grade using **nested conditions** for more accuracy

---

## Grade Breakdown Logic

- A = 90–100  
    - A+ for 97 and above  
    - A− for 93 and below  
- B = 80–89  
    - B+ for 87 and above  
    - B− for 83 and below  
- C = 70–79  
    - C+ for 77 and above  
    - C− for 73 and below  
- F = below 70

## 💬 Notes

This project builds logical thinking using only conditional statements — no loops or functions were used. It’s a real-world use case for learning how to handle multi-condition decision-making in Python.
