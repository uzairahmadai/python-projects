# Logical Rewards System ‚Äì Python Beginner Project

This project was created as part of the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/). It uses logical operators to simulate a reward system in a game based on player performance and decisions.

---

## Project Objective

Create a Python program that:
- Asks the player for their score
- Checks if they collected **all keys**, **any key**, or **completed the level**
- Gives a reward based on the following logic:

---

## Reward Logic

- **Big Reward**: If the player scored more than 100 **and** collected all keys  
- **Small Reward**: If the player **completed the level** or collected **at least one key**  
- **No Reward**: If none of the above are true

The project uses logical operators (`and`, `or`) and conditional statements to evaluate outcomes.

## üí¨ Notes

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:
- Logical thinking with `and` / `or` operators
- Boolean input handling (`yes`/`no` ‚Üí `True`/`False`)
- Real-world-style condition chaining
