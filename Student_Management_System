# 🧑‍🎓 Student Management System – Python Beginner Project

This is a beginner-level Python project created as part of the **Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer (CAE)** program at [PIAIC](https://piaic.org/).

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Create a basic student management system using **Python lists**.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Add a new student using `append()`
- Remove a student by name using `remove()`
- Display all students in alphabetical order using `sorted()`
- Count the total number of students using `len()`

All of this is done **without using functions, loops, or conditional statements** — keeping the code beginner-friendly and aligned with our early-stage learning in Python.

## 💬 Notes

This project is part of my public learning journey. I'm documenting everything I learn step-by-step to build my portfolio and confidence as a self-taught developer.
